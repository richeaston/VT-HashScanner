# VT-HashScanner
Virus Total hash Scanner.

This utility will allow you to scan either a single (or multiple via csv, or txt file ingestion) file hash against Virus Total*, you will require an API key, and there are inbuilt throttle limitations based on the key you have, for example a corporate API key can disable the throttling feature completely.

The results will be displayed in an easy to read, color coded datagrid which can be exported to csv report.
