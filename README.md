# VirusTotal Hash Scanner

This utility allows you to scan single or multiple file hashes (via CSV or TXT file) against the VirusTotal API.

## Features

* **Single or Bulk Scanning:** Scan a single file hash or ingest a list of hashes from a `.csv` or `.txt` file.
* **API Key Integration:** Requires a VirusTotal API key. Throttling limitations are built-in and can be adjusted based on your API key type (e.g., corporate keys can disable throttling).
* **Color-Coded Results:** View scan results in an easy-to-read, color-coded datagrid.
* **Exportable Reports:** Export the scan results to a CSV report.
